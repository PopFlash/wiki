## Pricing FAQ

##### Can I play PopFlash for free?

Yes, you can host free PopFlash matches, however they are limited to short matches (16 total rounds + overtime). If your friend has PopFlash Supporter, you can play in their full matches for free as well.

##### Can I cancel my subscription at any time?

Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time â€“ if you do, you will still keep any time you have paid for through the end of your month.

##### Can I pay with Paypal?

I'm sorry, but at this time we only accept credit or debit card payments. If you would like to, you can try setting up a "virtual card" with Skrill which shouldn't cost any money. You can use that to pay for PopFlash.

##### Can I boost a community or team?

Yes, you can. Go to any community page, hit the "Boost" tab, and you can boost your sub there. If you want to boost your own community, go to Pricing > Manage Sub > Adjust Quantity.
