* More simultaneous matches
* Retakes servers
* Higher demo tickrate
* In-Game Spectating (coming soon)

#### What tiers do each number of boost mean?

* 1 boost
  * 1 simultaneous match
  * Practice Servers

* 2 boosts
  * 2 simultaneous matches
  * Practice Servers
  * Retakes Servers

* 3 boosts
  * 3 simultaneous matches

  * _In-Game Spectating_ (coming soon)

#### How can I upgrade?

If you have a subscription and would like to add more boosts yourself, go to Pricing > Manage Sub > Adjust Quantity. Or your friends can apply their Supporter subscriptions to your community.
