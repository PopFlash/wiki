## Discord Integration FAQ

#### What is the PopFlash Discord Bot?

By adding the PopFlash Discord bot to your server, you will get:

* On match start: the connect info shows up directly in the server
* After knife round: we will move all the players\* into voice channels for each team
* After the match: we will post the results, a screenshot of the match stats, and the download demo button
* A handful of commands to interact with PopFlash directly from your server

\* (who have connected their Discord account to PopFlash)

#### Do I have to have PopFlash Supporter for this?

Yes, this is only for communities and teams that have PopFlash Supporter.

If you are a free user and would like to utilize the voice channel management, you can hang around in the voice channel waiting room (silently) and the bot will move you to PopFlash voice channels automatically after knife round. You can talk in game to all players during warmup and halftime.

#### How do I connect my Discord to PopFlash?

An admin in this community/team who is also an admin of your Discord server must click the "Add Discord Bot" button above and follow the instructions.

PopFlash's Little Helper will let you know when they've joined the server.

If you don't see a button to connect it's because this community is either already connected to a server or you do not have PopFlash Supporter. If you think something is wrong, or you'd like to change which server this community is connected to, please contact me in the PopFlash Discord (instructions below).

#### Commands

* `/setpopflashchannel` will tell PopFlash's Little Helper which channel you'd like her to post in
* `/scrim` will create a new scrim or share the URL to an existing scrim
* `/score` will post a summary of the latest match in the server

If you have ideas for more commands, reach out to me in the PopFlash discord below
