## Practice Server FAQ

Hello, and welcome to PopFlash Practice Servers. These are 6 slot 128-tick servers designed to help you test nade lineups, executes, and other in-game events.

To wit, we've integrated the very comprehensive and powerful Practice Mode from [@splewis](https://popflash.site/user/6018). You can find the original plugin and the deepest information about it here: [https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode) along with it's wiki: [https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode/wiki](https://github.com/splewis/csgo-practice-mode/wiki).

PopFlash will automatically back up your nades, spawns, and other data between practice server launches. If you run into any issues, we have backups, so reach out should a problem arise or you lose your data.

##### Get started

Once you join the server, type `.setup` into chat. This will present the practice mode setup menu:

{/* TODO: [image of prac menu] */}


##### Grenades

You can save grenades in practice mode. We will save your grenades between practice sessions on PopFlash.

To save a grenade, type `.save [grenade name]` where [grenade name] is the name you want to save. If you're unhappy with the last grenade you've saved, type `.delete`.

Type `.nades` to see all the grenades you've saved.


##### Teleporting

Type `.last` to teleport to the last place you threw a grenade. Type `.back` to cycle through your grenade history. Type `.back 3` to teleport back three grenades. `.forward` works as you'd expect.

Type `.flash` to save your current position for the next time you throw a flashbang. When you throw a flash, you will teleport to the position in which you typed `.flash`.

`.throw` will throw the last grenade you threw.
